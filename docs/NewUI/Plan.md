- Code cleanup and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Final visual design adjustments

## Implementation Notes

1. **Start small and build incrementally**. Begin with the atomic components and build up to larger composite components.

2. **Use the existing API client and services**. The backend is already implemented, so you can leverage the existing API client in `apiClient.ts`.

3. **Follow the atomic design methodology**. Keep components organized in atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates folders.

4. **Keep state management simple**. Use Svelte stores for shared state like orders and authentication.

5. **Test regularly**. Make sure each component works as expected before moving on to the next one.
